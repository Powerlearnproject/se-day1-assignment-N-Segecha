#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the methodical application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems by using structured methodologies and tools to create software that is reliable, efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.
Importance of software engineering in the technology industry includes: 

i. It is the foundation of modern technology since software drives almost all the existing technological innovations like mobile apps and also in industries like healthcare.
ii. It ensures that applications meet high standards of functionality, performance, and security thus reducing the risk of system failures or vulnerabilities, which is critical in areas like banking or critical infrastructure.
iii. Software engineering practices ensure that software can grow with user needs while remaining efficient.
iv. It enables rapid innovation by developing tools and platforms that help solve real-world problems, like improving medical diagnoses or automating tedious tasks.
v.  Software engineering minimizes errors and rework through structured development and testing processes, saving time and money for businesses.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

i. The Emergence of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s–1960s)
 The advent of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) revolutionized software development by allowing programmers to write more abstract, human-readable code paving the way for faster development and wider adoption of computing.

2. The Development of Structured Programming (1970s)
 This approach emphasized breaking programs into smaller, manageable modules using control structures like loops and conditionals, leading to better software design and maintenance.

3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001 Onward)
 Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. This approach contrasts with the traditional "waterfall" model, enabling teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver value more efficiently.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement Analysis: Stakeholders gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. This phase ensures a clear understanding of what the software is expected to do.
2. System Design: Based on the requirements, developers create a blueprint of the system architecture, user interface, and data flow. This serves as a guide for the development phase.
3. Implementation (Coding): Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built using programming languages and tools.
4. Testing: The software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, verify functionality, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.
5. Deployment: Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to the production environment, making it accessible to end users.
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software is monitored for performance and errors. Regular updates and improvements are made to keep it functional and relevant.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

i. Waterfall methodology is Rigid and Inflexible while Agile methodology is 	Highly Adaptable
ii. Waterfall methodology approach is Linear and Sequential while Agile methodology approach is Iterative and Incremental
iii. In Waterfall methodology Feedback is	gathered after the product is built while in  Agile methodology feedback is Continuously integrated during development
iv. In Waterfall methodology the Documentation is	Extensive and comprehensive while in  Agile methodology the documentation is 	Minimal and focused on essentials
v. Waterfall methodology is suitable for Fixed-scope projects,i.e.  predictable projects like in Construction or manufacturing projects, where requirements are fixed, and changes are difficult once the process begins while Agile methodology is suitable for Unpredictable projects, i.e. rapidly changing projects like	Startups or dynamic environments, where requirements may change frequently e.g., developing mobile apps or e-commerce platforms.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively interact with and guide AI models. It involves crafting instructions, questions, or context in a way that encourages the AI to produce accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.
Importance:
1.	Maximizes AI's Potential: Well-crafted prompts unlock the full capabilities of an AI model by providing clear and specific guidance, resulting in better responses.
2.	Improves Accuracy: Precise prompts help eliminate ambiguity, reducing the chances of generating irrelevant or misleading information.
3.	Enables Customization: Through carefully engineered prompts, users can tailor the model's output to match their tone, style, or domain-specific needs.
4.	Saves Time: Effective prompts minimize the need for multiple iterations, allowing users to quickly obtain the desired outcome.
5.	Supports Complex Tasks: For advanced use cases (e.g., code generation, creative writing, or detailed analysis), prompt engineering ensures the AI understands and meets specific requirements.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Which island is found in the ocean."
Improved Prompt:
"Which island is found in the Indian ocean in the Tanzanian waters"
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective :
1.	Clarity:	The improved prompt specifies the exact topic (specific region) instead of the broad and undefined term "ocean."
2.	Specificity: It outlines the key aspects to include: Indian ocean, and Tanzanian waters.
3.	Brevity: A word limit helps ensure the response is concise and to the point.
4.	Targeted Outcome:	By providing explicit details, it guides the AI to produce a well-structured and informative output, reducing ambiguity.
